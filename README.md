# ガイド (gaido)
Anki Vocabulary set for guidetojapanesegrammar.com

This is my vocabulary list to work with guidetojapanesegrammar.com.
It uses Google-TTS (using the Wavenet-AI) as well for pronounciation.

Vocab is introduced by order of appearence in the vocabulary lists for each lesson.
No duplicates are present.

Each Note has a field called "chapter" which states the first point in the course where this word appears.
This is mainly for easier filtered deck creations.

## Disclaimer
The pronounciations are based of the field "Japanese" and not "Reading" since the latter is not always populated.
Because of this, for some kanji composites, reading and sound differ.
These will be fixed manually over time as i learn them.
